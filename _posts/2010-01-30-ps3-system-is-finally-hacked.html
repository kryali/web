About a week ago, George Hotz finally hacked the PS3. This game console has been incredibly secure for the past 3 years.  Hotz used an interesting memory glitching attack which is described in depth <a href="http://rdist.root.org/2010/01/27/how-the-ps3-hypervisor-was-hacked/">here</a>.

The PS3 relies on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor">hypervisor</a> for security enforcement. A hypervisor is a software system that controls the system's hardware and monitors guest operating systems. Hotz used a memory vulnerability in the hypervisor to add his own functions, to write and read. This enables low level access to all parts of the hardware, thus opening the system.

The PS3 is a great technical machine. I'm interested to see what the homebrew community will do with the ability to use the PS3's revolutionary cell processor
