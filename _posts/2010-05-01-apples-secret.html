I finally understand apple's secret and what makes their products such a pleasure to use. They understand the users. They show people that playful side of technology that not enough companies show. Apple shows us how to enjoy new technologies. Technology is fun to play with, it's a toy. Don't forget about that. Play with the world.

So, build a company that shares the joy of technology with its products. Build a brand name in that sense, and push into the market. 

There are a few key things about aesthetics. The most important quality is responsiveness. Next comes simplicity. Then comes flow, and ease of use. These qualities are something that should be prominent throughout your software, your user interface, your user design, your brand name, and your branding. 
<ul>
	<li><strong>responsiveness</strong></li> A good interface is all about having a conversation between the user and the product. In order to perserve the quality of that conversation, you must react to the user: constantly engaging them. Subtle minimal messages in the product can help accomplish this. There is no need for a barrage of dialog boxes. 
	<li><strong>simplicity</strong></li> Trim down the users need for input to the bare necessities. There are many situations arise that the user is enslaved to pound in values that aren't quite necessary for everyday use. Keep it simple, keep it clean. Extraneous inputs are impurities that corrupt flow.
	<li><strong>flow</strong></li> Flow is the key for a pleasurable interaction between the user and the product. Remember that a great conversation is dominated by a smooth flow and progression. Make a logical interaction, each step of the way. Your product must make sense, so follow a steady rhythm.
</ul>

I want everything that I build and produce to hold these same qualities, they are the things that truly count. No one cares about how elegant your back-end is designed or how clean your code is (though those are good things). The UI is the product, why don't more people understand that?
