The software engineers at Facebook have outdone themselves and released an incredibly useful project called HipHop for PHP.
<blockquote>HipHop is a source code transformer that programmatically transforms your PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then uses g++ to compile it. ... Hip Hop includes a code transformer, a reimplementation of PHP's runtime system, and a rewrite of many common PHP Extensions to take advantage of these performance optimizations.</blockquote>

PHP is a scripting language known to be inefficient in terms of memory and CPU usage. Thus, HipHop addresses this inefficiency by rewriting PHP into C++ in order to utilize C++'s performance. This optimization helps reduce the CPU load by fifty percent on <strong>average</strong>. HipHop can be used to improve countless web applications utilizing PHP, making the web a faster, and more efficient place.
