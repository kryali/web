Today, I was just experimenting with typography in web design and I stumbled upon this nifty javascript utility called Cufón. <a href="http://cufon.shoqolate.com/generate/">Cufón</a> is a fast text replacement utility that allows web developers to take advantage of custom fonts. 

There are two main modules, a font generator and a rendering engine. The generator builds a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">SVG</a> based on the input to Cufón. This SVG is then sent to the renderer and displayed through the use of the HTML5 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element">canvas </a>element for most browsers. For internet explorer, this utility takes advantage of its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language">VML</a> engine. Thus, Cufón is an extremely fast and efficient fast text replacement utility across browsers.

The strength of Cufón lies in the ease of its use. It just works. With simple CSS selection, Cufón injects custom fonts to anything. I was able to take advantage of this feature to create this current theme. The navigation links and the date all display images based on a custom font rendered by Cufón.

There's an easy-to-follow guide to Cufón located <a href="http://wiki.github.com/sorccu/cufon/usage">here</a>.
