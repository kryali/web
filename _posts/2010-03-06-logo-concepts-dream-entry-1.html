Last night after unofficial (which was awesome by the way), I had a vivid dream. There are a few main points that I remember: browsing Isaac Cheng's Facebook profile, who posted a status displaying rooms of Siebel Center and how incredible it is. I promptly responded saying, "And No, those comfortable chairs don't make staying awake any easier :p" (or something to that nature). Another aspect I remember is Anthony. We were in a restaurant or some dining area, I can't really recall who we were with as it was unimportant at the time. For some reason I found him in my dream, confident and strong. I believe his real strength, and any man's real strength is in his confidence and his friendliness. I wish he wasn't in a cult, only time can tell what will happen.

Now to the interesting part. I was with Jake Bae and we were in a data mining course inside Siebel center for some reason. The professor there was an Indian man with an extremely Americanized accent. He was somehow situated above the lecture room, as if peering down as a judge. As he was explaining the lecture, there was constant clicking and clattering. Curious to the sound, I explored further, and realized that the clicking and clattering were sounds coming from devices he laid out to demonstrate his concepts. One machine I remember, was a data mining of Benjamin Franklin. There were four piles of newspaper like substance with icons of Franklin, surrounding a larger picture of Franklin winking with a thumbs up sign. I found this quite comical. Basically, the machine was using pieces of the newspapers and items around him, compressing the information and then processing as part of the image. Essentially building the image out of the raw materials. 

I found this very, very interesting. So I think a logo possibility should incorporate the concept of massing many technologies together, in some fashion.
