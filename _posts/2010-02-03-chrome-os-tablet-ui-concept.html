After the dust of the iPad settled, chromium devs released a concept of a chrome OS tablet.
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="560" height="340" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/debO2FroXA0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/debO2FroXA0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;hd=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

The video shows a pretty simple and minimalistic UI.  All the apps pop up in a launcher, triggered by a long touch, eliminating reducing the clutter on the desktop. The design looks fantastic. Unlike the iPad, the concept shows off the ability to multitask. Multitasking is a feature that really shines with multitouch. The fact that the iPad shows no plans for such design is a great dissapointment.

Chrome OS, has a great potential to succeed in the market because of the growing availability of mobile internet. Let's just hope that google holds to its unofficial  motto: "Don't Be Evil"
