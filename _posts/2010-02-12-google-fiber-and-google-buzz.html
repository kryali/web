Google has been all over the internet for the past few weeks. First with the <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Nexus One</a>, and now with two new projects they just announced. One of the projects google unveiled is called <a href="http://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi">Google Fiber</a>.

This project hopes to push an extremely fast, experimental broadband network to anywhere from 50,000 to 500,000. The projected internet speed is roughly 1gbps, an incredible speed. 1gbps is around one <strong>hundred</strong> times faster than the internet most people have today.

In addition to Google Fiber, Google released <a href="http://www.google.com/buzz">Buzz</a>. Buzz is a social networking feature that Google has integrated directly into gmail, so everyone with a gmail should be noticing this change. And if not, will notice so in the next few days. 
Buzz is google's answer to social networking sites such as twitter and facebook. It allows direct integration from Google Reader, Flickr, Picasa, Youtube, and Google Chat. It's also a great way to share content with all your google contacts.
