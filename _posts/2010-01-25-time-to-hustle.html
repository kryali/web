Today I read a very inspiring <a href="http://ihumanable.com/blog/2010/01/hustle/">article</a>. There was one passage in particular that struck home for me.
<blockquote>If there is one key thing I could convey to anyone reading this is to <strong>hustle</strong>. You will never be prepared for the things you are capable of doing. You will achieve your greatest accomplishments not by building up a grand framework of skill and then deftly creating something glorious, but by starting small and persevering in making it better and better. It is never an easy road and you will gain a grand framework of skills, but you have to push your boundaries to grow.
-Matt Nowack</blockquote>

I'm a budding computer science student on the brink of the world. There are too many ideas and projects mustering in my mind, all of them daunting and seemingly impossible. And I will always be unnerved until I start <strong>doing</strong> them.

 Two weeks ago, I started off with no knowledge of CSS and only a general understanding of web design. I wanted to create a blog to document my projects and my learning process for the benefit of others and my own. I went through many mockups and made endless changes, unhappy with every single design. I was stuck in a spiral of dissatisfaction. But I was not easily deterred. I wrote CSS/XHTML for every single mockup, and with each iteration my understanding grew and my talent for design increased.

Eventually, I realized the qualities that I wanted in my design was simplicity, elegance, and efficiency. 
Because of my persistence, I'm glad to say I've finally settled on a design that matches both my personality and my philosophy. 

Life is short. Most people don't realize that fact before it's too late. So my advice to you is the same as <a href="http://ihumanable.com/blog/about/">Matt Nowack</a>'s advice: <strong>hustle</strong>.
