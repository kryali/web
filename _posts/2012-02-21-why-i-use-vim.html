I've been a vim user for nearly two years, but I still feel as though I've barely scratched the surface. For me, vim is a tool that evolves as my skill evolves. The `.vimrc` is notorious

As a developer, almost all my time is spent within a text editor.

With raw text editors like TextMate and Notepad++, there is a limit to how efficient you can become. With vim, that limit barely exists.


To the programmers out there -- Don't be put off by vim's notorious learning curve. After all, you wouldn't have picked up programming if you were afraid of learning curves :)
