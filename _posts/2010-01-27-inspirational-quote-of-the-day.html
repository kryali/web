<blockquote>"When a person seeks, it can easily happen that his eye sees only the thing he is seeking; he is incapable of finding anything, of allowing anything to enter in to him, because he is always thinking only of what he is looking for, because he has a goal, because he is possessed by his goal. Seeking means having a goal. Finding means being free, being open, having no goal. You, Venerable One, are perhaps indeed a seeker, for, striving to reach your goal, you overlook many things that lie close before your eyes." - Siddhartha</blockquote>

Saw this quote when I was browsing <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/auuk1/how_do_you_find_your_passion_in_life/c0jialy">reddit</a> today. Siddhartha is a great read which quite altered my own perspective of the world. This book was the first step that I took towards self-improvement and reflection. Definitely a book everyone can benefit from.

In unrelated news, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">apple tablet</a> got released today. After all that hype, I can't say that I am too impressed. I mean seriously, the damned thing doesn't even have flash. My bet is that the apple's tablet, the ipad, will fade into the dark just like Apple's Macbook Air.

Today I plan to finalize the design for this site and work a little bit more on the wordpress port.
