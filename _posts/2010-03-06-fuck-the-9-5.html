Fuck no I don't want to work in a 9-5 job. I want to be serene, I want to be peaceful. I am a free mind, the way the universe developed me. I am free-moving, ever-changing, ever-evolving. The human mind is a spectacular phenomenon. The method in which it operates is magic, above our current comprehension. It's potential is unknown and impossible to understand. The only way to build the mind, is to consciously develop it. I am in an era of self-development. Everything I must do is to better myself. 

That means that now I need to become healthy. The mind is the engine and my body is the fuel. No longer should I produce sub-grade fuel to my engine.

I'll have to do it till I get some loose cash and pay off my student loans. But fuck, the sooner the better. And boy, I hope it won't be too long.
