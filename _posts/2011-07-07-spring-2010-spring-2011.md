<p>My 6th semester of undergraduate college at the University of Illinois is over (<a href="http://illinois.edu/">illini reppin</a>) , so naturally I should take some time to reflect on this academic year. It's been quite a wild journey.. where do I even begin?</p>

I suppose that I should begin at the end of the previous academic year. Last year I came to the realization that I am obsessed with the challenge of building something new. A lot of people look at software engineers like magicians. People have this perspective because engineers have the ability to engineer anything that our minds can imagine. That ability is one of the most empowering abilities I've ever experienced.

Ever since then, I dived in full throttle into Web and Mobile development. I felt like I was already so far behind because many of my peers have been coding for years. So if I wanted to catch up, I'd have to push myself, learn faster, and work my ass off. And that's exactly what I did.

Last summer, I taught myself basic web design and learned <strong>HTML/CSS3</strong>. Built my own awesome <strong>Wordpress</strong> themes (you're looking at the fourth one). I got my first job as a freelance project doing web design and development for <a href="http://business.illinois.edu/pct">Phi Chi Theta</a>. Boy, you should have seen the old one. 

The fall is when things start getting really crazy. When I came back to the school, I hit the ground running because I felt so far behind. I taught myself Javascript to build an app called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PWTlUTprr8">CoursesIllinois</a> for a Palm application competition. Started from scratch two nights before without knowing WebOS or much Javascript. Built the core of it in around ~12-18hrs.  The application placed in the top three for the competition! Continued it as a class project [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PWTlUTprr8">a video overview</a>]. <a href="https://github.com/kryali/coursesIllinois-WebOS">Code is open sourced</a>.

During the winter, I re-imagined the mobile application as a web application. Started my own education software project/startup to help make students and teachers lives easier. Recruited friends for it. Used it to teach myself Ruby on Rails. Learned how incredibly challenging a startup can be. Pitched it to students who loved the idea. Met some pretty incredible people. Now I just have to finish it's execution.

Got my first job at a company during the fall doing part-time mobile development work at an awesome startup on campus. The company builds iOS applications for huge european clients. Didn't really know iOS development or objective-C. So, I started watching iOS development tutorials but I got too bored to finish them and just dove straight into the code after a week. First project I did was to take someone else's graph library and add multitouch to it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyEGzX2BbRw">[video overview]</a>

In March, I found myself in this crazy land of StartupBus. Our task was simple: Launch a new company. With strangers. In 48 hours. On a bus. I present to you RabbitQR [video overview]. There stories from that one, ask me sometime!

Somehow squeezing full-time student into all of that too, go figure.
