<p>I came to a realization today while I was using my Samsung Captivate. The hardware was solid, the screen was beautiful and the phone was incredibly fast. But I still felt it was subpar to an iPhone.</p>

<p>The iPhone changed the world, no matter how you look at it. They changed the way we interact with technology and we are still feeling the ripples of that impact today. Apple gave the ability for any developer to reach out to millions of people. Using the lessons Apple learned from the iPhone they built the iPad and created a completely new industry out of thin air. iPad sales are expected to surpass 30m units this year.</p>

<p>Google, I love you to death and I use you more times than I would care to admit. But Android is only a shadow of the potential it has. It has market size, abundant hardware supporters, and a developing application system. All the pieces are there for Android to change the world, but something is missing.</p>

<p>Android needs a hero. The operating system needs a champion to redefine the way we use portable devices. The user interface needs a completely new redefinition. Rather than just revolving a phone around applications, revolve the phone around thing that are most relevant and interesting to the user. Everything Android has developed simply mimics Apple&#8217;s iOS. There is just too much underutilized potential.</p>

<p>Android&#8217;s savior is it&#8217;s open source nature. Google played their cards right. They realized that even if they don&#8217;t have a vision of the future, they built the tools for someone else to do it. Anyone has the potential to mold it into their vision of the future. It could be you, it could be me, it could be your next-door neighbor.</p>

<p>Apple, you blazed the trail and you started a revolution. But Google has to push us into the next phase. The mobile revolution has yet to begin.</p>
