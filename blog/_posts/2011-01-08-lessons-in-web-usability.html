If you design web sites and you have not read Steve Krug's book Don't Make Me Think, stop what you're doing right now and go read it. Seriously, don't even read the rest of this post.

Krug's book is a quick concise read that delivers powerful concepts about the way people use the web. For one thing, it really changed my perspective and reaffirmed many suspicions I had about how the average user uses the web.

For one thing, people don't read pages. They scan them as fast as possible.
<blockquote>"Web users tend to act like sharks. They have to keep moving, or they’ll die. "</blockquote>
So a website should be designed such that the user can understand everything about the page as quickly as possible. It must become <em>self-evident</em>. 

One way to do that is to reduce as much noise as possible. That means to get rid of elements that just don't make sense or aren't really that important. The less noise, the faster the user can understand what's going on and the better chance of the user sticking around.

Another important technique is to use visual hierarchy to develop logical relationships between your web elements. For instance, you can nest items within other elements to show ownership as a relation.

Not only should you focus on reducing noise, you should understand the importance of navigation. Navigation is a user's map in the web world. It's how they know where they are and where to go. At every page, the user should understand where he is and how the page fits into the hierarchy of the web. Krug's justifies this as his reason for his love of tabs.

Tabs are a great example of a clear navigation bar. They allow for an evident distinction of the current location of the user as well as show how other pages fit into the website.

Krug also designed a test to for web designers to see the usefulness of their navigation design.

<blockquote>"Imagine that you’ve been blindfolded and locked in the trunk of a car, then driven around for a while and dumped on a page somewhere deep in the bowels of a Web site. If the page is well designed, when your vision clears you should be able to answer these questions without hesitation"</blockquote>


<ol>
	<li><p>What site is this?</p></li>
	<li><p>What page am I on?</p></li>
	<li><p>What are the major sections of this site?</p></li>
	<li><p>What are my options at this level?</p></li>	
        <li><p>Where am I in the scheme of things?</p></li>
	<li><p>How can I search?</p></li>
</ol>
I'm only halfway through the book, and I've already learned this much valuable information. These chapters really are worth their weight in gold.
