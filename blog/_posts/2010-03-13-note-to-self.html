Ever heard the Serenity Prayer?
God, grant me the serenity To accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.
Cloud is pointing out that your reality is a construct of your own mind, specific only to you. It's not that the things you see as problems are problems, but that you see them as problems. If you weren't aware of the issue, you wouldn't stress and it wouldn't be a problem; in the same logic, if you didn't see it as an issue, it wouldn't be a problem.
So cloud is accepting the things he can't change, by willing himself to not see it as a problem, to see beyond it. I'm sure meditation also helps you see the problem in new ways, so that you can solve it more readily and not be blocked by the emotion you've wrapped the problem in. That's the courage to solve the problems, and awareness/truth/perception is the wisdom.
idk if he's trolling or not, but that's the basic idea. God is inside you, as long as you can open your third eye.</blockquote>
