I just came across this great website called Awesome-Fontstacks on delicious which seems to be a product of Rails Rumble 2010. This website distributes great looking web fonts along with related font-stacks as a fail-safe. 

The problem with existing solutions for custom fonts on the web is the lack of a cohesive solution. For example, my about page uses the Google Font Library. The font looks better while viewing it on OSX rather than on Windows. Most likely, this has to do with the way the operating system renders fonts. So, there needs to be a normalized solution so developers do not have to worry about what operating system their viewers are on.
