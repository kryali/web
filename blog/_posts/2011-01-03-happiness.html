So much of modern day society revolves around the doctrine that a stable steady job leads to happiness. People spend their lives following this doctrine. Yet I find myself asking one question; why? 

As a student, I'm constantly in search of motivation. I realized that my motivation is invention. We live in a world where the possibilities are endless. This is the information age, and information is growing at a rate faster than anyone has ever predicted. Never before in history has innovation been so exciting and rewarding. 

There are a few basic things people need to survive. Food, shelter, people, and purpose. This can be easily provided through money. So in essence, what people need is money. How much money does it take to live? Not that much. But people are under the impression that they need large quantities of money to have a successful life. I believe that people should focus on acquiring the things money can't buy, like passion.

Everyday ask yourself a question: Am I better than yesterday?
