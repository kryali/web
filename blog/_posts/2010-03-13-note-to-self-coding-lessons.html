<ul>Things i have learned about coding from doing a few 241 mps:
	<li>stop being afraid</li>
	<li>allocate large amounts of time to code (at least 2-4hrs) Otherwise, I realize that I do not get much work done</li>
	<li>Be weary about breaks - I wasted a bit too much time on a break, sometimes a break can kill the mood of coding</li>
	<li>Once you're in the zone, you're in the zone. don't stop till you drop </li>
	<li>Be secluded - can't do shit with distractions, it just isn't feasible. Brain will jump on anything to relax itself, that pussy </li>
</ul>

By the way, this looks beautiful on the clean theme. :-) Good job.
