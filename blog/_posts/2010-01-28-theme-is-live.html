The Wordpress theme I've been working on is now sufficiently coded to run. It has the very basic functionality that I need. You may notice that comments are nowhere to be found. I decided that comments were not in the mindset of this blog. The reason behind this design choice is to keep the site as simple and elegant as possible and to keep out as much clutter as possible.

There are a few CSS bugs that I need to iron out such as styling specific blog elements and making the theme compatible with IE. But for the most part, this is the design I envisioned. 

After that, I'll be working on coding some cool Wordpress plugins. Stay tuned.
