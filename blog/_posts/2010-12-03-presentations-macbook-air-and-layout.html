Over the last few weeks, I've seen a lot of presentations describing software projects and idea pitches. A lot of people tend to use long powerpoint presentations stuffed with long paragraphs and dreadfully painful slides. In my honest opinion, I believe that if you don't interest your audience within the first 30 seconds then you're doing it wrong.
<br />

<ul> Here are some guides I try to follow
	<li><strong>Never wing it</strong> - always have a strong idea of what you're going to say for each slide beforehand. You don't want to be standing at the screen looking clueless.</li>
	<li><strong>Use a lot of pictures</strong> - In terms of communication, there are not a lot of things that can communicate an idea better than a picture. People are visual!</li>
	<li><strong>Understand your audience</strong> - If you are pitching or presenting to a group of students, try to capitalize on things both relevant and interesting to themselves. Figure out whether or not people would be more interested in learning what you did as opposed to how you did it.  I have seen a lot of demo's and presentations where people dive right into technicalities before presenting the bigger picture.</li>
	<li><strong>Be bold</strong> - Talk with vigor and confidence. No one is going to pay attention to someone who does not even believe the things he/she is saying.</li>
	<li><strong>Be wary of text</strong> - While small text bullets can be useful in a presentations, never throw up a paragraph or a long sentence. That will result in an instant snoozefest. Instead, incorporate your information into your talk. After all, a powerpoint is just an aid.</li>
	<li><strong>Cut the crap</strong> - Get to the point, you cannot grab someone's attention by beating around the bush.</li></ul>

In unrelated news, I got a Macbook Air! Mainly, I wanted a mac to develop iPhone applications. Turns out macs are great for developers and having a lightweight, portable system is quite indispensable. Of course, the Air is definitely not for the average user. The Air is better suited for people that haven't used CD drives in years, work in the cloud all the time, and move around with laptops a lot. Pretty much any computer science student should be able to find the appeal in the air. That being said, the Air has a rather underpowered processor by today's standards. Apple has decided to make up for this by bringing a powerful GPU and an SSD. This has resulted in some interesting cases where the Air has outperformed the entry level Macbook Pro. All in all, I'm pleased with this shiny new toy. 


For the blog layout, I decided to go back to one of the first layouts I ever made. I realized recently that this minimalism is exactly the kind of style I wanted. There was no need in designing many other layouts, although it was fun and I learned a lot. This layout gets rid of the crap, and well - that pretty much describes me. I can see straight away a lot of elements that can be refined. Clean is just better.
