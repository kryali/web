I work at a startup called 004 Technologies USA. They are a company that is less than a year old with less than 10 employees. Everyone knows each other and we all work in a huge room together. You get to see and understand everything. There aren't any mysterious meetings, shrouds of secrecy, or binding NDA's. You sit across the room from the President and work on whatever you can get your hands on. There's more than enough work to go around so you're bound to find interesting.

So, interesting work, and an awesome environment is cool and all. But can't you get that at a big company?

There's one thing that's hard to learn at a big company. How do businesses get built? To me, that question is fascinating and mind numbing. It's the ultimate act of God. Create a business from scratch with your bare hands from just a glimmer of an idea. Fund it with pure will and sometimes magic just happens. Creation is the ultimate satisfaction and reward. That satisfaction what I love about software engineering. From nothing to something -- you can change the world.


We are lucky. We live in the future, the era of the internet. The world's knowledge is at our fingertips, on-demand, and distributed instantly. A kid in his college dorm room can make a huge splash in the world. Everyday I'm just blown away by the things we have built and the barriers we've broken. Have you ever thought about the fact that in just a few days we can go to the other side of the planet? How about the fact that you're reading this message on your computer from anywhere in the world?</p>
They say that sky's the limit. We're about to breach the sky.

So, work at a startup to learn that you can do <strong>anything</strong> and that your life is <strong>anything</strong> you want to make it.
Then go conquer the world. <em>Godspeed</em>.
