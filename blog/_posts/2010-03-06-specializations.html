<ul><strong>Goals</strong>

<li>1: have the necessary skills and or foundation to succeed in developing web-based, highly connective applications. </li>

	<li>2: have the ability to build mobile operating systems, and improve on them</li>

	<li>3: be extremely proficient in multi-core parallel programming</li>
<li>Ultimate Goal: All three. </li>
</ul>	

As for graphics, I'm curious about it, but am unsure about the future in the respective field and job opportunities as such.
