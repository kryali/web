<ul>On going list of project ideas	
<li>mtd BusTimes - finish this android app</li>
	<li>Create a JavaScript/Wordpress plug-in to hyphenate long words in text. Maybe make a tutorial on how I did it, build some traffic.</li>
	<li>Create a wordpress plug-in to display wiki definitions for suggested links. A fantastic one would be a download to pdf plugin. Open-source that bitch</li>
	<li>Build a kernel for Android, g1.</li>
 	<li>pic-a-day blog - make it different, find a way to promote it ( future )</li>
        <li>ultimate playlist exporter - process common forms of playlist files into online services like grooveshark</li>
