Recently I have been working on a personal project with an agressive deadline. The biggest mistake I made was failing to allocate my time on the tasks that required the most attention. The problem was that the aggressive deadline made my project goals almost impossible to meet.

So if project goals are unrealistic and aggressive, how do you meet deadlines and commitments? Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize. Â If you can not figure out what your truly important tasks are, then you will spend far too much time on far too little. Everything boils down to good time management. Time Management is an invaluable skill - so I went to my go-to guy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management">Wikipedia</a> to help me out. I found a pretty nifty task management technique called ABC Analysis.


<ul>
	<li> <strong>ABC analysis</strong> Prioritize your tasks with A, B, and C levels of priority
<ul>
	<li>"A" - do it now or else</li>
	<li>"B" - important but not immediate</li>
	<li>"C" - neither important nor immediate</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

This is awesome for prioritizing tasks and throwing out the crap that just plain doesn't really matter. Now you know what's important, what to spend the most time on, and what isn't critical to your project.
