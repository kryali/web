<blockquote>
Opening the entire Symbian platform removes barriers to direct involvement and will enable the Symbian community to grow more quickly. Individual contribution becomes much simpler, students and university research departments can engage much more easily and companies, small or large, can experiment with the code directly. Those who want to can now build a device based on the published Symbian code.

In short, we are lowering the barriers to allow everyone to play with the Symbian platform; something that we passionately believe is a good thing to do.  </blockquote>

This is an incredible victory for open source. Opening such a widely used platform as SymbianOS will allow developers all over the world the ability to innovate and revolutionize the mobile platform.
