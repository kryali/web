Here's a code snippet that grabs the latest tweets from a twitter user in python.

[python]
import urllib2 as urllib
import httplib, json

twitter = httplib.HTTPConnection('api.twitter.com')
twitter.request('GET', '/1/statuses/user_timeline/kiranryali.json')
resp = twitter.getresponse()
data = resp.read()
timeline = json.loads(data)

print resp.status, resp.reason

i = 0
for status in timeline:
  i += 1
  print &quot;@%s&gt; %s&quot; % (status['user']['screen_name'], status['text'])

print &quot;Latest %s tweets&quot; % i
[/python]

Here's how it works. The script sends a GET request to the twitter api for a specific user's timeline. Since we request the format in json, we can decode the string using pythons built in libraries From there, we have all the information we need. As simple as cake!
