<p>I work at a startup called 004 Technologies USA. They are a company that is less than a year old with less than 10 employees. Everyone knows each other and we all work in a huge room together. You get to see and understand everything. There aren&#8217;t any mysterious meetings, shrouds of secrecy, or binding NDA&#8217;s. You sit across the room from the President and work on whatever you can get your hands on. There&#8217;s more than enough work to go around so you&#8217;re bound to find interesting.</p>

<p>So, interesting work, and an awesome environment is cool and all. But can&#8217;t you get that at a big company?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s hard to learn at a big company. How do businesses get built? To me, that question is fascinating and mind numbing. It&#8217;s the ultimate act of God. Create a business from scratch with your bare hands from just a glimmer of an idea. Fund it with pure will and sometimes magic just happens. Creation is the ultimate satisfaction and reward. That satisfaction what I love about software engineering. From nothing to something &#8211; you can change the world.</p>

<p>We are lucky. We live in the future, the era of the internet. The world&#8217;s knowledge is at our fingertips, on-demand, and distributed instantly. A kid in his college dorm room can make a huge splash in the world. Everyday I&#8217;m just blown away by the things we have built and the barriers we&#8217;ve broken. Have you ever thought about the fact that in just a few days we can go to the other side of the planet? How about the fact that you&#8217;re reading this message on your computer from anywhere in the world?&lt;/p&gt; They say that sky&#8217;s the limit. We&#8217;re about to breach the sky.</p>

<p>So, work at a startup to learn that you can do <strong>anything</strong> and that your life is <strong>anything</strong> you want to make it. Then go conquer the world. <em>Godspeed</em>.</p>
